Submitted by:

This web app: **is a simple personal finance tracker where users can log transactions with an amount, description, and date/time, and instantly see their updated balance. The app displays transactions in a clean list with color-coded amounts (green for income, red for expenses), formatted dates, and a visually distinct cents display. In this continuation, I have improved the styling for better readability, formatted the datetime output for clarity, and prepared the backend to store and retrieve transaction data using a Node.js/Express server with MongoDB.**

## Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The user can add a new transaction with an amount, description, and date/time**

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] **Cents are displayed in a smaller font for a cleaner look**
- [x] **Dates and times are formatted into a more readable format**
