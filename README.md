Submitted by:

This web app: **is a simple personal finance tracker where users can log transactions with an amount, description, and date/time, and instantly see their updated balance. The app displays transactions in a clean list with color-coded amounts (green for income, red for expenses), formatted dates, and a visually distinct cents display. In this continuation, I have improved the styling for better readability, formatted the datetime output for clarity, and prepared the backend to store and retrieve transaction data using a Node.js/Express server with MongoDB.**
